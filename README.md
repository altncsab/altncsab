## Purpose of the repo

I have created this repo to produce sample codes and demonstration code to anyone interested to my capabilities. I could not use any of the code I have developed for a company I'm working / I've worked for, therefor I need to recreate something much simpler and similar what I have encountered so far.

I just started to populate the content recently and I will add new content based on what the job market demand.

This is a multipurpose repo. It will contain multiple solution with different topics.

## Content

- [Sql Script Runner](./SqlScriptRunner/Readme.md)
- [Nine Mens Morris](./NineMensMorris/README.md)
- Coming soon
